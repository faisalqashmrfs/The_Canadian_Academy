                        <p><img src="/Bullet.svg" alt="" />There are a wide variety of accommodation choices available to suit every budget when studying at The Canadian Academy in Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur. Whether you're looking for a modern condo, a private room, or a budget-friendly shared apartment, you'll find flexible options to meet your needs.</p>
                        <p><img src="/Bullet.svg" alt="" />While staying in the city center offers convenience, accommodations further from the city are often more affordable, making them a great choice for long-term stays.</p>
                        <p><img src="/Bullet.svg" alt="" />For the best balance of cost and convenience, we recommend finding accommodation along the Kajang MRT Line, as the Bukit Bintang MRT station Include Bukit bintang Monorail is just a few steps from the school. This makes daily commuting easy, fast, and budget-friendly—allowing you to enjoy both the energy of the city and the comfort of a home that fits your lifestyle.</p>
